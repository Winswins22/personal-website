# NOTES FOR FORKING
 Depending on what you want to do with this code, you may want to modify parts of the code so that it is more personalized. Additionally, some parts of the code are not easily transferable.  

 Here is a quick list of items you may want to change for quick reuse:

 - Replace your name in personal-website/src/components/Navbar/Navbar.jsx
 - Replace the navbar logo in personal-website/src/components/Navbar/Data.jsx and in 
personal-website/src/images/
 - Replace the text in all of the pages in personal-website/src/pages
 - Change your map location in personal-website/src/components/OSM_Map/OSM_Map.jsx
 - If you are reusing the contact form, create an EmailJS account and reconfigure the code inside personal-website/src/components/ContactForm. You may find 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgWGllOjkbs' helpful.
